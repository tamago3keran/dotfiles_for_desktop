# dotfiles_for_desktop
## Require
I am a Japanese Web engineer and I develop on a MacBook. I use a US layout keyboard, which I have set up to support Japanese. So I have introduced tools to support Japanese language as well as development.

### WezTerm
My [dotfiles](https://github.com/tamago3keran/dotfiles_for_docker) can not used properly with Terminal.app which is installed by default on Mac. So I recommend using WezTerm.

### Docker
I use Docker for the development.

### Karabiner-Elements
I need the tool because I use Japanese on a MacBook with a US layout keyboard.

### Clipy
I extend the clipboard functionality to improve development efficiency on my MacBook.

## Setup
Install the tools.

```
brew bundle
```
